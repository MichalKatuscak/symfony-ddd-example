# ADR-001: Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to design a system that handles Orders, Invoices, and Payments in a way that:

1. Follows Domain-Driven Design principles
2. Maintains clear boundaries between different business domains
3. Allows for independent development and deployment of each domain
4. Provides a clean and maintainable codebase
5. Supports scalability and extensibility

## Decision

We will implement a monorepo architecture with the following characteristics:

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with the following layers:
   - Domain Layer: Contains the business logic, entities, value objects, and domain events
   - Application Layer: Contains application services, command/query handlers, and DTOs
   - Infrastructure Layer: Contains implementations of repositories, external services, and persistence
   - Interface Layer: Contains API controllers, console commands, and other interfaces

2. **Bounded Contexts** for each business domain:
   - Sales: Handles orders and order items
   - Billing: Handles invoices and invoice items
   - Payments: Handles payment processing and transactions

3. **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) for integrations with external systems:
   - Domain defines interfaces (ports)
   - Infrastructure provides implementations (adapters)

4. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**:
   - Commands for changing state
   - Queries for reading state
   - Separate command and query models

5. **Event Sourcing (Light Version)**:
   - Domain events represent state changes
   - Events are stored in a Doctrine table
   - Projections materialize state for efficient reading

6. **Symfony Messenger**:
   - Command Bus (synchronous) for handling commands
   - Event Bus (asynchronous) for handling domain events
   - Doctrine transport for event persistence

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Each bounded context has its own domain model, reducing coupling between domains.
2. **Maintainability**: The layered architecture makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Testability**: Domain logic can be tested in isolation without infrastructure dependencies.
4. **Flexibility**: Each bounded context can evolve independently.
5. **Scalability**: The system can be scaled by domain, with high-traffic domains receiving more resources.

### Negative

1. **Complexity**: The architecture introduces more complexity compared to a simple CRUD application.
2. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing concepts.
3. **Development Overhead**: More code is required for the same functionality compared to simpler architectures.
4. **Performance**: The additional layers and message passing can introduce some performance overhead.

### Mitigations

1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation will help developers understand the architecture.
2. **Code Examples**: Providing clear examples for common patterns will reduce the learning curve.
3. **Tooling**: Using code generation tools can reduce the development overhead.
4. **Optimization**: Performance-critical paths can be optimized as needed.
