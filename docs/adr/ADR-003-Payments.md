# ADR-003: Payments Domain

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Payments domain is responsible for handling payment processing in our system. We need to:

1. Support multiple payment methods (bank transfer, credit card, etc.)
2. Integrate with external payment providers
3. Ensure payment security and compliance
4. Handle payment lifecycle (pending, completed, failed, refunded)
5. Communicate payment status to other domains

## Decision

We will implement the Payments domain with the following characteristics:

1. **Domain Model**:
   - Payment Aggregate: Represents a payment with its lifecycle
   - Payment Methods: Different payment methods with their specific rules
   - Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each payment transaction
   - Payment Events: Events that represent changes in payment status

2. **Hexagonal Architecture**:
   - Core Domain: Contains the payment business logic
   - Ports: Interfaces for external integrations
   - Adapters: Implementations for specific payment providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)

3. **Payment Lifecycle**:
   - Pending: Payment is created but not yet processed
   - Completed: Payment has been successfully processed
   - Failed: Payment processing has failed
   - Refunded: Payment has been refunded

4. **Integration with Other Domains**:
   - Listens for InvoiceIssued events from the Billing domain
   - Creates a pending payment when an invoice is issued
   - Emits PaymentReceived events when a payment is completed
   - Billing domain updates invoice status based on payment events

5. **Security and Compliance**:
   - No storage of sensitive payment information
   - Use of tokenization for payment methods
   - Logging of payment events for audit purposes
   - Compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., PCI DSS)

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple payment methods and providers
2. **Isolation**: Payment processing is isolated from other domains
3. **Security**: Sensitive payment information is not stored in our system
4. **Auditability**: All payment events are logged for audit purposes
5. **Extensibility**: New payment methods can be added without changing the core domain

### Negative

1. **Complexity**: Integration with external payment providers adds complexity
2. **Eventual Consistency**: Payment status may not be immediately reflected in other domains
3. **Error Handling**: Payment failures need to be handled gracefully
4. **Compliance**: Need to ensure compliance with relevant regulations

### Mitigations

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Use of adapters isolates the complexity of external integrations
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Events ensure that payment status is eventually consistent across domains
3. **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry mechanisms for failed payments
4. **Security Reviews**: Regular security reviews to ensure compliance with regulations
